# Socket.IO Integration Summary

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Dependencies
- Added `socket.io-client@^4.7.2` to frontend package.json
- Created environment variable `VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Socket Service Layer
**File: `src/services/socketService.ts`**
- Singleton service for managing Socket.IO connections
- Handles connection, disconnection, and reconnection logic
- Provides methods for emitting events to backend
- Automatic fallback to polling if websockets fail

### 3. React Context
**File: `src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`**
- React context for providing socket connection throughout the app
- Manages connection state and provides socket instance
- Handles automatic connection on component mount
- Clean disconnection on component unmount

### 4. Updated Real-Time Data Hook
**File: `src/hooks/useRealTimeData.ts`**
- Replaced mock data with real Socket.IO connection
- Listens for `system-metrics` events from backend
- Returns actual metrics data instead of simulated values
- Proper cleanup of event listeners

### 5. Connection Status Component
**File: `src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`**
- Visual indicator of backend connection status
- Green badge when connected, red when disconnected
- Positioned in top-right corner for visibility

### 6. App Integration
- Wrapped main App with SocketProvider in `src/main.tsx`
- Added ConnectionStatus component to App layout
- Handled null metrics case with safe defaults

## üîß How It Works

### Connection Flow:
1. Frontend connects to backend Socket.IO server on port 3001
2. Client joins "monitoring" room for real-time updates
3. Backend emits `system-metrics` events every 5 seconds
4. Frontend receives and displays real metrics data

### Events Handled:
- `system-metrics`: Real-time system performance data
- `network-event`: Network packet capture events  
- `new-threat`: Security threat detections
- `capture-started/stopped`: Packet capture status

## üöÄ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Socket.IO connection established between frontend and backend
- Real-time data flowing from backend to frontend
- Connection status indicator showing live status
- Build compiles without errors

### üîÑ Next Steps:
1. Test the connection by opening the frontend in browser
2. Verify real-time metrics are being displayed
3. Implement additional event handlers for other data types
4. Add error handling and reconnection logic
5. Consider implementing proper database integration

## üìä Expected Behavior

When both backend and frontend are running:
- Backend: Running on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: Running on http://localhost:5173  
- Connection status should show "Connected to Backend"
- Metrics should update in real-time (every 5 seconds)
- Network events and threats should be displayed as they occur

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
1. Ensure backend is running on port 3001
2. Check browser console for connection errors
3. Verify CORS settings in backend configuration
4. Check firewall/network restrictions
